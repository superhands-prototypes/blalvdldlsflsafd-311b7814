description: "Starter template cleanup - remove placeholder content if present"
alwaysApply: true
---

**IMPORTANT: This rule only applies if the default template content is still present.**

Check if App.tsx contains the placeholder text "You're all set" and "Start chatting with agents to build your prototype."

**IF the placeholder content exists:**
1. Delete all elements in App.tsx and replace with:
```tsx
export default function App() {
  return (
    <div className="app">

    </div>
  )
}
```
2. Delete the template CSS in src/index.css (styles for .onboarding-callouts, .callout, .callout-arrow, etc.)
3. Delete this rule file: .cursor/rules/template.mdc
4. Then address the user's request

**IF the placeholder content does NOT exist:**
- Skip cleanup - the template has already been customized
- Delete this rule file: .cursor/rules/template.mdc (it's no longer needed)
- Proceed directly with the user's request
