Never change the current browser window location. Do not use:
- window.location
- window.location.href
- window.location.replace()
- window.location.assign()

If you need to navigate to an external URL, always open a new window/tab using window.open().

CRITICAL: Never modify, redirect, or change the /preview route URL. The preview URL is managed by the Superhands platform and must remain unchanged. Do not:
- Add redirects from /preview to other routes
- Change the /preview path in any routing configuration
- Modify URL parameters on the preview route
- Create navigation that would leave the /preview context
